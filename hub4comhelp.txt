Usage:
  C:\Users\Dell-001\Downloads\SerialSplitter\hub4com.exe [options] <port0> [options] [<port1> ...]

Common options:
  --load=[<file>][,<begin>[,<end>]][:<prms>]
                           - load arguments (one argument per line) between
                             <begin> and <end> lines from a file <file> (use
                             standard input if empty) and insert them into the
                             command line. The syntax of <prms> is
                             <PRM1>[,<PRM2>...], where <PRMn> will replace
                             %%n%% in the arguments. Do loading since begining
                             if <begin> is empty. Do loading till end-of-file
                             if <end> is empty. Ignore arguments begining with
                             '#'. <file> will replace %%0%% in the arguments.
                             It is possible up to 256 recursive loads.
  --help                   - show this help.
  --help=*                 - show help for all modules.
  --help=<LstM>            - show help for modules listed in <LstM>.

  The syntax of <LstM> above is <MID0>[,<MID1>...], where <MIDn> is a module
  name.

Route options:
  --route=<LstR>:<LstL>    - send data received from any port listed in <LstR>
                             to all ports (except itself) listed in <LstL>.
  --bi-route=<LstR>:<LstL> - send data received from any port listed in <LstR>
                             to all ports (except itself) listed in <LstL> and
                             vice versa.
  --echo-route=<Lst>       - send data received from any port listed in <Lst>
                             back to itself via all attached filters.
  --no-route=<LstR>:<LstL> - do not send data received from any port listed in
                             <LstR> to the ports listed in <LstL>.
  --fc-route=<LstR>:<LstL> - enable flow control route from any port listed in
                             <LstR> to all ports listed in <LstL>.
  --no-default-fc-route=<LstR>:<LstL>
                             disable default flow control route from any port
                             listed in <LstR> to all ports listed in <LstL>
                             (default flow control route enabled from P1 to P2
                             if enabled data route from P1 to P2 and from P2 to
                             P1).

  If no any route option specified, then the options --route=0:All --route=1:0
  used by default (route data from first port to all ports and from second
  port to first port).

Filter options:
  --create-filter=<MID>[,<FGID>[,<FN>]][:<Args>]
                           - by using filter module with name <MID> create a
                             filter with name <FN> (<FN> is <FGID> by default)
                             and put arguments <Args> (if any) to the filter.
                             Add filter to the end of filter group <FGID>
                             (<FGID> is <MID> by default). Any filter can
                             accept described above option --load=[...].
  --add-filters=<Lst>:<LstF>
                           - attach the filters listed in <LstF> to the ports
                             listed in <Lst>. These filters will handle the
                             data by IN method just after receiving from ports
                             listed in <Lst> or by OUT method just before
                             sending to ports listed in <Lst>.

  The syntax of <LstF> above is <F1>[,<F2>...], where the syntax of <Fn> is
  <FGID>[.<Method>][(<Lst>)], where <FGID> is a filter group, <Method> is IN or
  OUT and <Lst> lists the source ports (the data only from them will be handled
  by OUT method). The <FGID> w/o <Method> is equivalent to adding IN and OUT
  for each filter from the group <FGID>. If the list of the source ports is not
  specified then the data routed from any port will be handled by OUT method.

Port options:
  --use-driver=<MID>       - use driver module with name <MID> to create the
                             following ports (<MID> is serial by default).

The syntax of <LstR>, <LstL> and <Lst> above is <P1>[,<P2>...], where <Pn> is a
zero based position number of port or All.

Examples:
  C:\Users\Dell-001\Downloads\SerialSplitter\hub4com.exe --route=All:All \\.\CNCB0 \\.\CNCB1 \\.\CNCB2
    - receive data from CNCB0 and send it to CNCB1 and CNCB2,
      receive data from CNCB1 and send it to CNCB0 and CNCB2,
      receive data from CNCB2 and send it to CNCB0 and CNCB1.
  C:\Users\Dell-001\Downloads\SerialSplitter\hub4com.exe --echo-route=0 COM2
    - receive data from COM2 and send it back to COM2.
  C:\Users\Dell-001\Downloads\SerialSplitter\hub4com.exe --load=
      --echo-route=0
      COM2
      ^Z
    - the same as above.
  C:\Users\Dell-001\Downloads\SerialSplitter\hub4com.exe --load=,_BEGIN_,_END_
      blah blah blah
